# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualization

🚀 **EDA & Visualization on a Real-World Dataset** 📊🔍

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a real-world dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights using **Python and data visualization techniques**.

## 📊 Key Steps
- **Dataset Loading & Exploration**:
  - Used Pandas to load and inspect the dataset.
  - Checked for missing values, data types, and basic statistics.
- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handled missing values using **imputation or removal**.
  - Removed duplicate records.
  - Identified and treated outliers using **statistical techniques**.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - 📊 **Bar charts** for categorical variables.
  - 📈 **Histograms** for numerical distributions.
  - 🔥 **Correlation heatmap** to understand feature relationships.
- **Insights & Observations**:
  - Summarized findings from the analysis.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy** 📊
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** 🎨
- **Scikit-learn** 🤖

## 📌 Insights & Findings
- **Patterns** and **correlations** were identified.
- **Anomalies and missing data** were addressed to improve data quality.
- **Key observations** were documented to guide future analysis and modeling.

## 🤝 Acknowledgment
- **This project is part of my internship tasks**.
- **Big thanks to Developers Hub** for their support and guidance! 🙌
